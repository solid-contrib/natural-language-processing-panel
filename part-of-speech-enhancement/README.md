# Part of Speech Enhancement in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Natural Language Processing Panel](https://github.com/solid/natural-language-processing-panel).

## Goal

The aim of this is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines standards and mechanisms needed to allow transforming plain text to linked data with part of speech and language ontologies, such as the NIF Core Ontology.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
