# Solid Natural Language Processing Panel

Focused on developing standards for extending Solid with capabilities in Natural Language Processing.

Areas of interest include speech to text and vice versa, part of speech tagging, query pipelines for extracting and adding meaning, vocabularies, shapes, footprints, and the mechanisms through which these things (and others) work together to achieve  natural language processing.

For contributing members see the

## Part of Speech Enhancement

### Goals

To identify and define standards and mechanisms needed to allow transforming plain text to linked data with part of speech and language ontologies, such as the [NIF Core Ontology](https://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html)

## Query Pipelines for Language Enhancement

### Goals

To identify and define standards and mechanisms needed to allow creation and use of pipelines of Sparql queries to identify abstract concepts in linked data with the aim of enhancing plain text with language ontologies.
