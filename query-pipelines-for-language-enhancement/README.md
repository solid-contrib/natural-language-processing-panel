# Query Pipelines for Language Enhancement in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Natural Language Processing Panel](https://github.com/solid/natural-language-processing-panel).

## Goal

The aim of this is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines standards and mechanisms needed to allow creation and use of pipelines of Sparql queries to identify abstract concepts in linked data with the aim of enhancing plain text with language ontologies.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
