## Query Pipelines for Langage Enhancement in Solid use cases

Bob has a resource on his Solid server which is text enhanced with rdf describing things like sentence boundaries and parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.  He has a container of Sparql queries that he wants to execute in a sequence on this rdf resource to extract meaning from it and enhance it (add tags to it) accordingly.
